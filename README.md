# Honeybadgers and Hashes

Honeybadgers and hashes is a Ruby exercise that I wrote to assist students in learning the fundamentals of object oriented programming in Ruby. The tests are provided (Minitest). Students can write the code necessary to make each test pass and then "unskip" the next test. It is an introduction to Ruby, nested hashes, advanced enumerables and test driven development.
